## Single-Cell Genomics: A Stepping Stone for Future Immunology Discoveries
The immune system is one of the most dynamic and adaptable systems in the human body, creating a complex network that connects nearly every tissue. Characterising the unique interactions of immune cells is crucial to enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. Since the 19th century, studies pioneered by Ilya Mechnikov have categorised immune cells into distinct types based on their morphology and cellular functions. Technological advancements have accelerated immunological identification studies. However, the belief that a small number of molecular determinants sufficiently describe the diversity of immune cells has been disproven, as immune cell identity largely depends on their tissue and environmental context. 

Single-cell sequencing, therefore, solves the challenge associated with the heterogeneity of immune cells, as it can characterise the various cell types and states involved in immune cell functions. Single-cell sequencing facilitates the modelling of gene expression profiles from a bulk of cells, thereby overcoming the limitations of bulk sequencing, including challenges in reproducibility, sensitivity, automation, microfluidic technologies, and noise. 

Key challenges are limiting the full potential of single-cell genomics in immunology. These include analytical complexity occasioned by large datasets that encompass thousands of cells having diverse transcriptional profiles, and other computational hassles such as accurate classification of cell types, differentiating subtle functional states, and filtering technical noise. 

Importantly, single-cell approaches now integrate with flow cytometry, CyTOF, imaging, lineage tracing, spatial transcriptomics, and CRISPR-based perturbation assays. These multimodal strategies reconnect transcriptional profiles with protein expression, spatial location, and clonal history, promising to restore contextual understanding while overcoming limitations of dissociated single-cell RNA-sequencing. Collectively, these advances reveal the full diversity, organisation, and functional states of the immune system across health and disease. Hence, single-cell genomics is an indispensable tool for decoding immune diversity, playing a major role in biomarker discovery and therapeutic innovation.
