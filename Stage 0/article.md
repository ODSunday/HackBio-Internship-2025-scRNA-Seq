# What single-cell data is teaching us about cancer evolution: Connecting scRNA-seq to tumour heterogeneity and therapy resistance

## Introduction

The clonal evolution (CE) model describes tumour progression through sequential genetic mutations in individual cells, analogous to Darwinian evolution, where diversification and selection based on cellular fitness lead to the emergence of dominant, more malignant subpopulations. The model has advanced in parallel with improvements in sequencing technologies, deepening our ability to observe genetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in tumours [1].

RNA sequencing methods have progressed rapidly from bulk RNA-seq to laser-capture micro-dissection, single-cell RNA-seq, and, more recently, spatial transcriptomics. This evolution of technology has revealed that cancer does not evolve by a single linear clone. Instead, multiple subclones often emerge and coexist, sometimes due to similar fitness or spatial separation, and can even complement each other’s survival. Clonal architecture varies substantially between individual tumours of the same type. In response, computational and experimental methods continue evolving to better model clonal dynamics and inform treatment strategies. [1, 3]

## Transition from bulk RNA-SEQ to scRNA-SEQ
Bulk RNA-seq has been foundational in cancer genomics, helping to classify molecular subtypes, measure gene-expression changes associated with mutations, and discover biomarkers. However, bulk RNA-seq averages the transcriptomes of all cells in a sample, masking the contribution of rare or distinct cell populations.
To overcome this limitation, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was developed. scRNA-seq enables transcriptomic profiling at the resolution of individual cells, which allows detection of rare cell types, intermediate states, and cellular dynamics. RNA sequencing has progressed to single-molecular, single-cell and spatial transcriptome approaches, improving the accuracy of cell-level resolution and contributing to our understanding of cancer heterogeneity and evolution. [2, 3]

## Uncovering tumour heterogeneity with scRNA-SEQ
Cancer cells display significant variability in their gene expression patterns, which corresponds to diverse cellular conditions that vary in their ability to multiply, degree of specialisation, mechanisms to avoid immune detection, and responses to treatment interventions [4, 5]. This diversity originates not only from alterations in DNA sequences but also from additional mechanisms, including modifications to gene regulation without DNA changes, random variations in gene activity, and signals from the surrounding cellular environment, such as low oxygen conditions, the presence of immune cells, and interactions with supporting tissue [6, 7]. For example, specialised connective tissue cells associated with tumours and immune cells that have migrated into the tumour mass can trigger adaptability in gene expression patterns within cancerous cells, facilitating characteristics linked to tissue invasion or treatment resistance [8]. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has proven to be a critical approach for dissecting this complexity through the analysis of gene activity in individual cells. This technique allows researchers to detect uncommon cell subsets, intermediate cellular conditions, and developmental relationships that remain hidden when analysing mixed cell populations [9]. Additionally, scRNA-seq supports the tracing of cellular development pathways and the characterisation of interactions between tumors and their surrounding environment, providing an understanding of how diversity beyond genetic mutations influences cancer progression and treatment effectiveness [10].
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionised cancer research by allowing transcriptomic profiling of individual cells, which shows the remarkable heterogeneity that exists within tumours. Tumour cells from the same patient or lesion can display extraordinarily different transcriptional programmes where some show proliferative or quiescent signatures and others exhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stress responses, or drug-tolerant phenotypes [14]. These transcriptional differences reveal that tumour evolution is not a linear process but a dynamic mosaic of coexisting cellular states, some of which may drive progression or resistance to therapy  [12].
At the transcriptional level, tumour cells show variation in lineage markers, metabolism, and immune evasion pathways. scRNA-seq studies have identified distinct transcriptional patterns in melanoma, breast, and glioblastoma that correlate with clinical outcome and metastatic potential  [14]. This diversity enables tumours to adapt under selective pressures such as nutrient limitation or drug exposure, as some cell states are inherently more resistant. Importantly, bulk RNA sequencing masks this variability, but scRNA-seq resolves it with single-cell resolution, providing insights into tumour plasticity and clonal evolution.
Non-genetic heterogeneity results from epigenetic modifications, stochastic gene expression, and microenvironmental influences [11]. Epigenetic changes like DNA methylation and chromatin remodelling can lock cells into alternative transcriptional states, leading to heritable yet reversible phenotypic diversity [13]. Furthermore, the tumour microenvironment (TME) contributes substantially to heterogeneity. Factors such as hypoxia, cytokines, and extracellular matrix stiffness can reprogram tumour cell transcription, inducing phenotypes associated with invasion or drug tolerance [15]. scRNA-seq enables the identification of transcriptionally distinct clusters of tumour cells through dimensionality-reduction methods like UMAP or t-SNE, allowing the characterisation of subpopulations that differ in function and therapy response [12]. Trajectory and pseudotime analyses reconstruct developmental or adaptive transitions such as EMT or acquisition of drug tolerance, which highlights dynamic cellular plasticity  [14]. When combined with spatial transcriptomics, scRNA-seq further reveals how transcriptional states are spatially organised within the tumour and shaped by local interactions with immune or stromal cells [15].

## Tracking cancer evolution with scRNA-SEQ
Tracking cancer evolution with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed our understanding of how tumours grow, diversify, and adapt to therapy by allowing researchers to resolve gene expression patterns at the level of individual cells. Unlike bulk sequencing, which averages signals across millions of cells, scRNA-seq captures the heterogeneity of cancer, revealing distinct malignant subpopulations, stem-like compartments, and interactions with immune and stromal cells that drive progression and resistance. By profiling thousands of cells simultaneously, it is possible to reconstruct transcriptional trajectories that reflect dynamic state transitions within tumours, map differentiation hierarchies, and identify pathways that are activated during metastasis or under drug pressure. Although scRNA-seq primarily measures gene expression, it can also provide indirect information about genetic evolution through inference of large-scale copy-number alterations (CNAs), which distinguish malignant clones from normal cells and can be used to track subclonal expansion. Tools such as inferCNV, CopyKAT, and SCEVAN analyse expression patterns along chromosomes to assign each cell to a likely genomic lineage, offering insights into the clonal structure of a tumour. In addition, expressed somatic mutations and mitochondrial DNA variants, when detected with sufficient coverage, can serve as endogenous barcodes to trace cellular ancestry, although these signals are often sparse and noisy. Experimental lineage-tracing strategies, such as CRISPR-based barcoding, further enhance our ability to follow clonal evolution when applied in model systems. By integrating scRNA-seq with complementary single-cell modalities such as single-cell DNA sequencing, ATAC-seq, or spatial transcriptomics, researchers can directly link genotype to phenotype, connecting genetic diversification with transcriptional reprogramming and microenvironmental adaptation. Ultimately, this integrative single-cell framework provides a dynamic view of cancer as an evolving ecosystem, enabling the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships, the identification of drug-resistant clones before they expand, and the design of precision interventions that anticipate and block tumour evolution.

## Connecting scRNA-SEQ to therapy resistance
Because genetic and epigenetic differences between tumours of the same type in different patients can lead to drug resistance and therapeutic failure [16], integrating drug response data with scRNA-seq enables analysis at single-cell resolution and the identification of therapeutic clusters. Before Beyondcell, there was no computational method capable of inferring drug sensitivity from single-cell gene expression combined with high-throughput drug screening. With the Beyondcell approach, tumour responses to treatment can be monitored across different cellular subpopulations using scRNA-seq [17]. Studies have shown that scRNA-seq contributes to more effective therapies in various cancers, including glioblastoma, which previously yielded less accurate results [18].

## Challenges and future perspectives
A major limitation of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in solid tumours is that samples must be dissociated into viable single cells before sequencing. The mechanical and enzymatic steps used for dissociation often trigger stress responses that alter transcription and add technical noise, making it hard to tell whether gene-expression differences come from real tumour heterogeneity or from sample handling [19]. Because fresh material is usually required, collecting multiple or serial biopsies from the same patient is also difficult, which limits studies of tumour evolution over time. Some groups work with organoids or cell lines to avoid this problem, but those models do not fully reproduce interactions with the tumour microenvironment. Even with improvements such as single-nucleus RNA-seq and fixation-compatible workflows, technical noise and sampling bias still restrict the accuracy and clinical use of scRNA-seq in cancer research [20, 21]. Optimising fixation and storage protocols could greatly expand the clinical application of scRNA-seq, allowing more flexible sample handling and improving the study of tumour heterogeneity. Widespread implementation of these methods may enhance our ability to track cancer evolution and guide therapeutic strategies.
